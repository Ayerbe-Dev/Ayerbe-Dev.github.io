        This page makes searches to the the <a src = "https://dictionaryapi.dev/">
        FreeDictionary</a> API (which I found on GitHub) in order to display 
        information about a given word. I chose this because I felt like it would
        provide a lot of information that would be very intuitive to format. The
        only parameter that I needed to provide to this API was the word that I 
        wanted definitions for. This API would be really helpful in cases where 
        you want to know what a word means and also don't want to Google it
        directly.

                $("#search_button").click();
